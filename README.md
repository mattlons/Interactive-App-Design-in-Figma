### What is the Project?

This project involves designing an interactive educational app prototype aimed at helping users master a specific skill or task. The app employs intuitive interfaces and guided user flows to offer an engaging learning experience. It integrates features such as flashcards and progress tracking to make memorization and content retention more effective.

## How did I do it?

- ### Defined the Purpose
Designed the app to help users memorize content effectively using a scientific approach to learning, inspired by spaced repetition techniques.
- ### Outlined Key Features
Incorporated flashcards, interactive lessons, and progress tracking to enhance the learning process.
- ### Created Rough Sketches and Wireframes
Visualized the appâ€™s layout and user interface by drafting rough sketches.
Ensured a consistent design for a cohesive user experience.
- ### Developed the Prototype
Used Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype with interactive elements.
Designed at least 10 screens, focusing on functionality, user flow, and aesthetics.
Applied principles of consistency, visual hierarchy, and usability to enhance clarity.
- ### Tested and Refined
Conducted usability tests to identify potential issues.
Iteratively improved the design based on feedback and observations.

## Why I chose Anki and Challenges faced

I created this app prototype because of my interest in combining technology and education to make learning more effective and accessible. By focusing on a specific skill or task, the app can provide targeted assistance to users, ensuring better and more efficient learning.

### Challenges faced:
Defining and learning how to use the interactions between screens (highlighted by the blue arrows in the picture below) was the most difficult part as a beginner in Figma, by trial and error I was able to learn how to seamlessly link each screen.

### Future improvements
- #### Redesign Screens: Enhance the user interface for a more elegant and premium feel.
- #### App Development: Translate the design into a functional application.
- #### Expand Features: Add additional screens for tools like a "German dictionary" and customizable folders.
- #### User-Customized Flashcards: Introduce an area for users to design their own folders and flashcards.
